Added the sound for hovering on a button.
Implement the sounds to all buttons in all scene.

Added new prefab call reactScoreCanvas and reactScoreHolder for Reaction Mode.
Added the script for the reactScoreHolder. It shows the current reaction time to the player after he hits the target.
The reactScoreHolder will be self destoryed after 1 second.
Edited the menu scene and connected all the scenes.

4/19
Added new prefab call scoreHolder for Challenge Mode.
Added the canvas for scoreHolder. I think the text object can only be destroyed if it is under a canvas.
Added the script for the scoreHolder. The score Holder will show "+1000" text when the player hits the target. The scoreHolder 
will spawn when the target gets destroyed. The scoreHolder will spawn the same position as the related target. 
The scoreHolder will be self destroyed after 0.5 second.

Fixed the bug where if a player don't hit the target before next target spawns, two targets will stack together
which effects the total reaction time. Now the first target will self destroyed before second target spawns.
Fixed the "time" is not showing correctly because scripts are not linked properly.

4/7
Added the new target prefab for new scene "Reaction Mode."
Added the new scene called "Reaction Mode." In the mode, the player will need to hit the target as fast as
he can, then the time that he spent will be recorded. After 5 times, the average reaction time will be
calculated by totaltime / 5.
Added the new script call ReactionModeControl, it basically controls the whole scene, including buttons, UI,
and spawning targets.
Added the new script ReactionModeTarget, it record the time between spawn and destory, then send the time
to ReactionModeControl for the result calculation.

Edited the decrement speed of the target generation. At the start of the game, the decrement is 0.02f--. 1 minute after, the decrement become
0.002f-- since the game is already very hard at that time. Therefore, the player will not instantly die in the late games.
Edited the targetSelfControl script so the target size will change related to the time of being exist. I set the frame count = 100,
so the animation of the increasing size of target will be very smooth.
To be honest, I didn't do much since there's 3 midterms going on this week so I will do more on the following week after spring break.

3/22
Added a preparation time phrase before the game starts. Now when player clicks "Start" or "Restart", he will get a 3 second preparation time counting
down from "Get Ready", "3", "2", "1", "Go".
Edited the tagertGenernator script so the range of random target genernation will be smaller so the target will only appear inside of the grids.

Set the target to get deleted when player clicks the target. Therefore, it helps to save memory when large amount of targets
had been spawned.
Edited the script so when the player hits a target, he got +1000 score and hits +1. Whenever he clicked, shots +1. After that
the accuracy will be calculated base on = hits / shots. The total score will be = score * accuracy, which prevents player clicking
all the time because low accuracy will result a low score.
Edited the UI for "Challenge Mode", now there's a text object "Speed: " shows how many targets per second are spawning. Which indicated the current
level of difficulty.
Researched on how to use mesh TextMeshPro instead of normal text in the script.

3/10
Create the script for "Chanllenge Mode" to control the target spawning time to a linear time, also set target will
keep spawning unless player triggered gameover.

3/8
Created the "Challenge Mode", in this mode, as the time goes, the difficultly will increase. A play will have 3 bars of
health, whenever he missed a target, health -1, gameover when health bar = 0.

3/3
Set the UI canvas to fixed size of 1024x1024 for both in-game UI and main menu UI.
Created the script "TargetSelfControl." Now the player can use left click on the mouse to destroy the target.
Researched on how the main camera works since I countered a problem that sometimes clicking the target won't destroy them.
Adjusted the camera depth and field of view, now player will always destroy the target when they clicked the target.
Planning on doing a grade calculation script for next few weeks.

3/1
Created the UI for "Reflex Mode".
Created the script for the pause main menu. When the player press "escape" the pause main menu
will pop up and the time scale will set to 0. The player can either choose to go back to the game,
or back to the main menu.

2/24
Created the UI for the main menu scene. It contains buttons that directly player to different
scenes. I also added the temporary game title in the main menu scene.
Created script for the Main Menu scene.
